# DiscordFreeEmojis

If you don't have Nitro, post the emojis as links!

Install it as a [userscript](https://gitlab.com/An0/DiscordFreeEmojis/-/raw/master/DiscordFreeEmojis.user.js) or include the js file somehow else.  
If you have Discord installed, use the [installer](https://gitlab.com/An0/DiscordFreeEmojis/-/raw/master/DiscordFreeEmojisInstaller.ps1) (`ALT` + click to download, right click on the downloaded file and Run with PowerShell.)
